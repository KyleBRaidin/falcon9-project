# falcon9-project

## Project Overview

I am training a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not SpaceX will reuse stage 1 of their Falcon 9 rocket. In doing so, I can determine the cost of the launch based on the algorithm's outcome. The algorithm will be trained on publicly available data.
